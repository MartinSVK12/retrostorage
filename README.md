# RetroStorage 
Digital storage system mod for Minecraft r1.2.5. **Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/MartinSVK12/retrostorage/wiki)!**

# Maybe you're looking for the [BTA](https://github.com/MartinSVK12/retrostorage/tree/bta) or [b1.7.3](https://github.com/MartinSVK12/retrostorage) version instead?

Requires Forge for 1.2.5 (3.4.9.171+) and IC2 (1.97+). Currently, singleplayer only, probably (multiplayer wasn't tested).

*This version of the mod should work in classic 1.2.5 modpacks like Tekkit Classic without too much trouble (there might be id conflicts which can be solved easily).*

**Features**:
 - Digital Network (Store your items on a disc, no more chests!)
 - Autocrafting using Recipe Discs and Assemblers
 - Simple and Advanced I/O that can help you automate various machines!
 - and more to come.

**WARNING!**
Mod is in a potentially buggy **beta** state, there might be bugs even in the latest releases that haven't been found/fixed yet. Backup your worlds regularly! 

Please report bugs in Github Issues, and if you have any questions, I'm in the [Modification Station](https://discord.gg/8Qky5XY) discord server as MartinSVK12#0075.

_Have fun! :D_
